# tic-tac-toe

Install Pygame using command pip install pygame

In the ipynb file first main is for normal tic-tac-toe of board size 3 and winning positions is 3

second main for extended tic-tac-toe in which you can enter greater than 3

In normal tictactoe all algorithms are running fast .

Time will be decreased for further steps taking by the agent

In extended tictactoe of any size please don't run minmax,alphabeta algorithms takes morethan 20 minutes

And board size greater than 4   all algorithms takes more than 20 minutes.

Some time if you got stuck in pygame window you have to restart the kernel to stop that pygame.
 
For the first time you have to run all cells in the ipynb file and from next time onwards 

running the last cell(global variables and to start the game) is enough.
 
Select the board size, no.of coins in a row to win, algorithm to run the game.
  
 In game window you have to select the grid where you want to keep your coin.

 For the time being i mentioned the time taken by the agent for each of its previous step

 and the algorithm with which you are playing on the top of the board.
